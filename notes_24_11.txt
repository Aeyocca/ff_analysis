Possible ranking sources:

- ESPN 8 rankers, can use variance in rank to identify upside players??? This seems the dumbest

- ideally I want the watson lines... without having to click through everything
	- selenium clicking through these will probably be the only way
	- thats going to be an incredible pain, but why not start somewhere...

each week find a reliable place to get stats, probably EPSN box scores and calculate it myself?

This also does not factor in scoring bonuses, but is that really that important... 

fanduel is half ppr fwiw

100+ Receiving yard bonus = 3pt
300 passing yard bonus = 3pt
interception -1


would like to get hockey up and running also, chat with Keith about how to inject upside if that exists...
that upside should be baked into these average projections because people just use linear models for point estimates

This spits out a single lineup, but I can get a post hoc analysis of the probability of picking profitable lineups from this pool and how to pick a better lineup that the "top" or just submitting a handful of random ones, or if I can specify addition / subtraction of certain players
for example, want to stay away from Lamar against the steelers and dont really want to start two tight ends...

need the function for draftkings as well as fanduel

want to keep track of my own lineups also to track if there is an edge or if these projections are wrong as often as I am

I think if I had the watson things I could get higher upside... lets make that a goal


things to do:
- scrape watson boom / bust metrics
- setup a scrape of past scoring data (ESPN box score scraping)
	- do I loop the player pool? Naw just go every game that happened on a certain day / week... selenium again???

fuck yea they have specific gameIDs, get that from first page then we can just edit the url so selenium not necessary. Does 
- defensive scoring..... I can calculate this actually sadly, take everything except defensive/ST TDs (so just add TDs from the other team
- check 2 pt conversions and XPs
